# ========================================================

# Required Dependencies
# ---------------------

# High-performance async HTTP client (3-4x faster than requests)
aiohttp>=3.9.0

# Optional but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Performance

# Faster regex library (3x faster than standard 're')
# Provides significant speedup for domain validation and extraction
regex>=2023.12.0

# Progress bars for better UX (optional but recommended)
tqdm>=4.66.0

# Notes
# -----
# 1. aiohttp is REQUIRED for async I/O performance gains
# 2. regex is OPTIONAL but provides 3x regex speedup - highly recommended
# 3. tqdm is OPTIONAL but provides nice progress visualization
# 4. All other dependencies are part of Python standard library
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Minimal installation (no optional libs):
#   pip install aiohttp
#
# For maximum performance:
#   pip install aiohttp regex tqdm
#
# Python 3.13+ Free-Threading:
#   To get 2-3x additional speedup on Python 3.13+, install Python with
#   free-threading support (python3.13t or python3.14+) and the script
#   will automatically detect and use it.
